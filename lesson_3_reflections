When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably when you are concerned about memory on your computer or when you want it to be public only?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just in case you have some commits that you would want to place in another branch in your local repository.
