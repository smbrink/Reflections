When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably when you are concerned about memory on your computer or when you want it to be public only?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just in case you have some commits that you would want to place in another branch in your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to basically clone repositories from GitHub, clones are used to make copies of other repositories, and branches are used to keep track of changes you are making on your local repository. Forks will be used in GitHub, Clones and branches will be used on your local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to keep track of the status of your GitHub branch and check for conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could email code back and forth and copy and paste. Seems like GitHub would be alot faster and easier than email though.
